# LED Blink

This is a basic Arduino project where an LED is turned on and off at a fixed interval.

## Description
The goal of this project is to understand the basics of Arduino digital output, pin configuration, and timing functions.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- LED
- 220Ω resistor
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Circuit

## Code
The Arduino sketch is available in the `led_blink.ino` file.

## What I Learned
- How to use `pinMode`
- How to control digital output using `digitalWrite`
- How to use `delay` for timing
- Basic circuit setup with an LED and resistor

## Source of Learning
This project was built while following the FreeCodeCamp Arduino course.

## Next Improvements
- Control blink speed using a potentiometer
- Replace `delay` with `millis`
