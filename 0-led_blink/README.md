# LED Circuit (Analog)

This project is a basic LED circuit built on a breadboard without writing Arduino code.
The focus is on understanding basic electronics rather than programming.

## Components Used
- LED
- 220Ω resistor
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- Power source (Arduino 5V or external)

## What I Learned
- How to connect an LED correctly (anode and cathode)
- The role of a resistor in limiting current
- Basic breadboard usage
- Simple analog circuit concepts
- How voltage and current affect an LED

## Notes
No Arduino code was written for this project.
The goal was to understand the hardware and analog side of electronics.
